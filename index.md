Introduction:<br>
This is my first ePortfolio. This is a work in progress, so please be patient - it will get better (over time)!
The artifacts selected for my ePortfolio are to demonstrate my capabilities in software development. These artifacts
were selected from previos software courses I took at Southern New Hampshire University. <br>
After the artifacts were selected, I made additional enhancments to the code, illustrating ...

Description: The Code Review -<br>
In the presentation, I will be conducting the code review on three different projects from previous courses that I have taken here at 
Southern New Hampshire University. The purpose of the code review is a standard practice in the Software Development Life Cycle, for 
improving deliverables and user experiences while ensuring that code is concise, well-commented, and ready for updates. 
In this code review, I will discuss the code that relates to three key computer science categories: Software Engineering and Design, 
Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. I will analyze existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explain 
my plan for enhancements. During the code review, I will utilized the CS-499 Code Review Checklist.<br>
